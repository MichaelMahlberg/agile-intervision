## Preconditions and agreements

Some preconditions should be met to support a successful Agile Intervision session.

- General rules
    - The participant within one group are from different work contexts.   
(not in the same project, not line manager and employee, etc.)
    - ‘Vegas rule’: What is said in the circle stays in the circle
    - three to six participants per group (plus facilitator, where applicable)
- Strictly no chat about the case in the breaks or after the Intervision.
- Every participant is required to explicitly agree to these rules

## The hot-seat Intervision format

The session itself consists of five distinct phases. Some of the phases are timeboxed, as is the overall session. Some tweaking of the times may be necessary (e.g. according to group size), but once you begin a time-box, honor it. Inspect first and adapt in the next iteration.

Remember: it’s a **30 minute time-box per case**

1. **Explain the Case (case giver: <= 7 minutes)**   
The case-giver describes the situation they want to investigate and tries to give as much relevant information as possible to the observing peers.
1. **Share Observations (other participants: round robin)**
Each participants describes two observations about the case or the case giver they actually observed during the previous 7 minutes
(No suggestions for improvement, no general facts, suggestions or assumptions etc.)
1. **Select and Deepen Aspects (case giver: <= 4 minutes)**
The case giver deepens the description around those observations they deem most relevant for their situation
1. **Share Observations (other participants: round robin)**
Each participants describes two observations about the case or the case giver they actually observed during the previous 15+ minutes (round robin)
Still: No suggestions!
1. **Open discussion (facilitated by the case-giver)**
This discussion is facilitated by the case-giver until the end of the overall time-box allowed for this case (30 minutes).
This is the only portion of the session where suggestions are possible, though not encouraged

## Important notes

Ask participants to talk about something completely different in the break after the case. Do not pick up the case again.
